## Icon Design

The Splotch icon features a colorful rainbow gradient "S" in a friendly, thick bubble letter style with a cute face on the upper portion. The rainbow gradient flows from purple at the top through blue, green, yellow, orange, to red at the bottom - matching the app's color palette.

## PWA Configuration

The app is fully configured as a Progressive Web App and can be installed on:
- iOS devices (via Safari "Add to Home Screen")
- Android devices (via Chrome "Install App")
- Desktop browsers that support PWA installation

The app displays in fullscreen mode when installed, providing an immersive drawing experience.
