### [P2][duplication] Extract the two-blit subtractive glaze stamp shared by `flushCrayonBuffer` and `renderOp`

**File(s):** `web/src/lib/drawing/strokeOps.ts:395-413` and `473-489` — pinned at SHA f934d43

#### Problem

The exact "darken at alpha 1, then source-over at alpha `1-mix`" stamp is written twice:

```ts
// flushCrayonBuffer (399-410)
target.globalCompositeOperation = 'darken';
target.globalAlpha = 1;
target.drawImage(buf.ctx.canvas, b.x0, b.y0, w, h, b.x0, b.y0, w, h);
target.globalCompositeOperation = 'source-over';
target.globalAlpha = 1 - getCrayonMix();
target.drawImage(buf.ctx.canvas, b.x0, b.y0, w, h, b.x0, b.y0, w, h);

// renderOp crayonPassRaster (482-488)
target.globalCompositeOperation = 'darken';
target.globalAlpha = 1;
target.drawImage(op.canvas, op.x, op.y);
target.globalCompositeOperation = 'source-over';
target.globalAlpha = 1 - op.mix;
target.drawImage(op.canvas, op.x, op.y);
```

This subtractive-mix formula is the crux of the crayon look (per the long pass-buffer note). Having
it in two places means a fix or tuning must be mirrored, and the two already differ subtly
(device-rect blit vs paper-space draw) — a source of the ±1 rounding reconcile documented in
`undoHistory.ts`.

#### Proposed solution

```ts
function stampGlaze(
  target: CanvasRenderingContext2D,
  source: CanvasImageSource,
  mix: number,
  draw: () => void,
);
```

or simpler, two thin variants sharing a core that sets the two composite/alpha states around a
caller-supplied `drawImage`. Both call sites reduce to one line each and `globalAlpha` is guaranteed
reset.

#### Verification

`npm run test -- crayonBrush` plus the crayon commit/undo E2E; visual parity on `/dev/engine`. A
unit test can assert the composite-op/alpha sequence via a mock 2D context.

### [P2][complexity] `generateAiImage` bundles six concerns in one 95-line try/catch

**File(s):** `web/src/lib/drawing/aiImage.ts:94-188` — pinned at SHA f934d43

#### Problem

`generateAiImage` opens the modal, exports the canvas, sets the preview, encodes WebP, builds auth
headers, fetches, `switch`es over four response kinds, and drives auto-save — all inside one
function with a trailing `catch`/`finally`. The auth-header construction (135-140) and the response
`switch` (150-169) are each self-contained units that obscure the top-level flow.

#### Proposed solution

Extract:

* `function buildGenerateHeaders(uploadBlob: Blob): Record<string,string>` (135-140),
* `function handleAiResponse(response: AiImageResponse, runId, imageBlob): 'done' | void` — the
  150-174 switch + finish/auto-save.

`generateAiImage` then reads as: launch → export → upload → dispatch. Keeps the same `runId`
ownership checks.

#### Verification

`npm run test -- aiImage` (the existing 387-line suite) must stay green — it already exercises
safety/throttle/error/timeout branches, so an extraction that changes behaviour will fail it.

### [P3][duplication] Crayon-buffer allocate-or-resize logic is written three times

**File(s):**
`web/src/lib/drawing/strokeOps.ts:229-252 (`livePaperBufferFor`), 299-322 (`crayonBufferFor`)`; also
engine `resizeCanvas` overlay loop `web/src/lib/drawing/engine.ts:428-437` — pinned at SHA f934d43

#### Problem

The pattern "create a canvas at WxH, set `lineCap/lineJoin='round'`; on later calls, if the size
grew, reassign width/height and re-arm caps and reset `dirty`/`bounds`" appears in both
`livePaperBufferFor` and `crayonBufferFor` almost verbatim, and the cap-arming half repeats again in
the engine's overlay resize loop.

```ts
// crayonBufferFor 313-320 and livePaperBufferFor 240-250 — near-identical bodies
buf.ctx.canvas.width = w;
buf.ctx.canvas.height = h;
buf.ctx.lineCap = 'round';
buf.ctx.lineJoin = 'round';
buf.dirty = false;
buf.bounds = null;
```

#### Proposed solution

`function ensureBufferSize(buf: CrayonPassBuffer, w: number, h: number): void` that grows the
backing canvas, re-arms round caps, and resets `dirty`/`bounds`. A
`function newRoundCanvasCtx(w, h): CanvasRenderingContext2D | null` covers first allocation and the
engine's overlay/snapshot canvases (also duplicated in `undoHistory.ensurePaperCovers`,
`adoptPaperAsSnapshot`, and `engine.snapshotStrokes`).

#### Verification

`npm run test -- crayonBrush` and the resize/rotation E2E. Unit-test `ensureBufferSize` for the grow
and no-op paths.
