# Audit — deferred findings

> Findings the scripted audit burndown (the `burn-down-audits` skill) moved aside instead of fixing
> — the verifier was unavailable, the implementation failed, or the change never passed adversarial
> review. Each needs human triage: re-stage it in `docs/AUDIT.md`, file it as an issue, or drop it.

The 2026-07-27 triage pass reviewed the 49 findings deferred up to that date and drained them from
this file: 30 FIX verdicts were re-staged in `docs/AUDIT.md` with resolution guidance, 9 OPTIONS
verdicts became `type:audit` + `needs-triage` GitHub issues (564-572), and 10 DROP verdicts were
retired with rationale. The disposition index (`docs/audit-deferred/triage/README.md`) and full
original texts remain in this file's git history — the triage directory was removed once every
verdict was dispatched.

The 2026-07-28 triage pass reviewed the 15 findings that arrived after that pass and drained them
too: 13 FIX and 2 DROP verdicts, each recorded as a standing decision doc in
`docs/audit-deferred/decisions/` (see its `README.md` for the verdict index and per-finding
rationale). Full original finding texts remain in this file's git history at commit 5b16292; the
rolled-back draft patches under `docs/audit-deferred/*.patch` are kept where a decision doc cites
them as reusable raw material.

The 2026-08-10 pass drained the findings that had arrived after those passes: each was either
implemented directly on the working branch or retired with a decision doc in
`docs/audit-deferred/decisions/` (see its `README.md` for the verdict index). Full original finding
texts remain in this file's git history.

The inbox is currently empty — no findings are awaiting triage. New deferrals from future burndown
runs land below this line.
